      writable, checks for save_mode=on, choice to keep old directory or use new default directory
    - Beefed up log view with size in bytes and entries and button to reduce log to last 500 entries
    - Length of random password can be set to 4, 5 or 6 characters,
      if members want to change their passwords, the same minimum number of char is required
    - New Password are required to have at least an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter and a cipher.
    - Expires date converts entries like 1.1.15 to 2015-01-01 (suggested by Ludwig)

    - Bugfix (in activation form) reported by cmb

3.4beta (September 2013)
    - In admin-mode saving members list will send only changed values to server to prevent data loss

3.2.1 (March 2013)
    - on IIS-Servers the plugin didn't work. cmb came up with a solution involving a new definition

      advantages as csv files, except for up/downloading/backup

      to the site's contact email, or, if not entered, to the sender's email entered in memberpages
